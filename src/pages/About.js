                                        I am a self-taught artist! I've been drawing since forever, from the humble beginnings of making my own pokemon or dragon trading cards, to eventually getting into manga and anime, as well as Visual Kei later on. I believe that all of these interests shaped my style and the things I enjoy creating most! </p>
                                    <p> If I had to pick my favorite things to draw, it would be Original Characters above all - I am not really a fanart kind of artist. But my passion is also to design many new characters, both for myself and to sell as adoptables via deviantArt or Patreon. My strengths lie in all things fantasy, be it Kemonomimis (preferably, cats and bunnies) or mythical creatures such as Demons, Faun, Centaurs, Aliens and of course my own Species! </p>
                                    <p>On this website, you will be able to find examples and prices of both my commissions, customs and adoptables, as well as hopefully some info on the worlds and/or species that I came up with. If you'd like to contact me, feel free to on any of my socials below! I am most active on deviantArt, however. </p>
                                    <p>Thank you for reading! ðŸ’—</p>
